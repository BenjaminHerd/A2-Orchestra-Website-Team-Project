                <h1>Twilight</h1>
                <h2>(September 2015) By Judy Hunter, photographs taken by Gai Copeman</h2>
                <p>
                    Twilight was a community project to mark the 30th birthday of Dance North. The theme of the performance was sensing sea, sky and earth through connection with place.
                    It involved over 150 performers over more than 14 locations on the beautiful headland at Jezzine. It was a performance in motion with the audience moving from one location
                    to the next shepherded by volunteer guides.
                    <br>
                    The performance began before sunset and continued while the sun went down and the horizon changed colour. The later stations were lit by candles and lighting concealed
                    in the vegetation.
                    Performances ranged from the Brass members of the Barrier Reef Orchestra who could be found at several stations, through school dance students, to the Forever Young over 60s.
                    It included Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dance and music groups, Kith and Kin, Aquapella, who had just returned from a successful tour to Europe, WASSA, our African
                    drummers and Teepee Parkour who leapt over walls and stairs and were accompanied by Boris doing amazing stunts of his lit up bicycle.
                    <br>
                    In perhaps a first for Townsville one section of the show involved a mobile phone orchestra. The audience were encouraged to download an app on which original music had been recorded
                    and the audience played this on their phones to accompany a recorder solo.
                    <br>
                    The finale was with the dancers from Dance North and the BRO Brass playing original music composed by the Musical Director, Ng Chor Guan from Malaysia. Guan had composed almost all
                    the music for the production. The overall Artistic and Creative Direction was in the hands of Cheryl Stock AM who was the founding Artistic Director of Dance North from 1985 to 1996.

                <h1>Review Of The World Music Concert </h1>
                <h2>By Helen Land</h2>
                <img src="images/HelenLand.jpg">
                <p>
                    The World Music Concert was a breath of fresh air to Townsville music lovers who had just about reached classical music saturation following AFCM.

                    Andrew Ryder poured his expertise and enthusiasm into this opportunity provided through Townsville City Council sponsorship. Andrew developed the
                    concept for the concert; sourced the music which involved him personally arranging some of the music; liaising with the professional performers; and
                    rehearsing and conducting the Barrier Reef Orchestra.

                    The performance delighted more than one sense through the visual backdrop showing scenery pertinent to the music and the amazing musical sound evoking
                    toe tapping, clapping, singing and sheer enjoyment.

                    The world tour began with David Hudson on didgeridoo, guitar and vocals synchronizing with the visual backdrop to grab the audiencesâ€™ attention, performing
                    the popular John Williamson ballad Raining on the Rock. The tour continued through Korea and Cuba courtesy of a quality Barrier Reef Orchestral performance.
                    Next, virtuosic Domenico Taraborrelli on piano accordion and vocalist Adam Lopez, supported by the Orchestra, engaged the audience with Latin American pieces.
                    Unfortunately the balance was a little off, with the soloists being much louder.

                    The second half began with the Barrier Reef Orchestra creating an American theme through Aaron Copland before heading off to Europe with the Orchestra supporting
                    Domenico once again in Italy, John Ferguson on bagpipes with vocalist Cynthia Clark in Scotland and Adam Lopez in Spain.

                    The tour aptly returned to Australia with all the soloists returning to the stage to present a rousing and emotive performance of I am Australian.

                    This very enjoyable performance once again demonstrated the talented people choosing to live in Townsville and able to produce such a high class production, equal
                    to anywhere. This was reinforced by the willingness of quality professional musicians to come to Townsville and perform with the Barrier Reef Orchestra. I feel certain
                    if more was known about the concert the Civic Theatre would easily have been at capacity.

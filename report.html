<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Improve exposure and as a result, enitice more people to join the barrier reef orchestra.  Therefore, the design has to draw the viewers attention to the orchestra's  and generate exposure to the wider public in general.  On the main page, the client wants a focus and ease of access for people to join easily, possible fundraising element in play as well. Main problem was too much text on front page, there is a lot of information the client wants, so be wary.</p>
    
<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Jose Oronos: </strong> - Main theme of CSS, page layout, main page and membership page with form javascript and social media integration and mobile device compatibility</li>
    <li><strong>Robin Foster: </strong> - Events page and 1/2 of gallery page (Javascript)</li>
    <li><strong>Tariq Tarbuck: </strong> -  People page and breadcrumb links and associated pages, other 1/2 of gallery page</li>
    <li><strong>Benjamin Herd: </strong> - Plan, about us and FAQ pages, trello board set up and github repository set up</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>Form validation may work for some fields only, and leads to a thank you page only, doesn't send any data off (membership page).</p>

<h2>PMI</h2>

<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Work well as a team, able to come together and help each other out as necessary.  Kept on track with deadlines for certain pages and the assignment.  Able to communicate quickly and coherently as a team, with Slack integration so all members knew what was happening.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Some members may have felt undermined due to inexperience with HTML and CSS in the past, and our Lecturer's unfortunate accident with no replacement in lectures disadvantaged some of us.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> There is a lot of work and design thinking that goes into making a good web page.  Making sure the information flows with easy to find navigation and decent aesthetics to make it pleasing for the user.  Clearly defined goals and well thought out plan beforehand definately helps with further development.  Having a team that can communicate clearly with each other and cooperate using various programs and being able to meet up in person only helps with website development and team cohesion, would be especially useful for large projects such as this.  </p>

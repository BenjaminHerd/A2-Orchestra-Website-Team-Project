<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan - Barrier Reef Orchestra </h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Ben Herd, <br>
<strong>Login:</strong>jc320973</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Improve exposure and as a result, enitice more people to join the barrier reef orchestra.  Therefore, the design has to draw the viewers attention to the orchestra's  and generate exposure to the wider public in general.  On the main page, the client wants a focus and ease of access for people to join easily, possible fundraising element in play as well. Main problem was too much text on front page, there is a lot of information the client wants, so be wary.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> During a 3 month trial period, success will be evaluated by determining an increase in attendance to events, and the number of people contacting the orchestra to join.  For the events, a 50% increase to the attendance of performances by the orchestra, as well as a 50% increase in the number of people requesting to join.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>A large range of demographics, from young kids in high school to mature aged adults.  Also, the orchestra accomodates the reef as it's theme, so marine colours (of various shades of blue and lighter green) may be more suitable here, should suit the logo as well (harmonise). </p>
